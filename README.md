# Jamazon - Event Manager 📅🚀

**Jamazon** (also known as *Dynamic Events*) is a desktop application developed in Python for the efficient management of events and resources. It uses a modern graphical interface and advanced data structures to handle scheduling and avoid resource conflicts.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Task Management:** Easily create and delete tasks.
* **Event Definition:** Schedule events with specific date and time ranges.
* **Resource Management:** Add resources and handle dependencies between them.
* **Conflict Detection:** Intelligent system that checks if necessary resources are available and do not conflict with other rules.
* **Modern Interface:** Dark and friendly GUI based on `customtkinter`.

## 🛠️ Installation and Execution

Follow these steps to run the application in your local environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VIRUSGAMING64/Jamazon.git
   cd Jamazon
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📖 Usage Guide

Upon starting the application, you will see a control panel with the following options:

* **Create new task:** Opens a form to register a new task in the system.
* **Remove existing task:** Allows deleting tasks that are no longer needed.
* **Add Resource:** Adds new resources (e.g., rooms, equipment) that can be assigned to events.
* **Define new event:** Creates complex events that require resources and have a specific duration. The system will automatically validate if resources are available and if there are dependency conflicts.

## 🧠 Technical Details and Modules

The project is built with a modular approach. The main components are detailed below:

### 1. Core (`modules/`)

* **`app` (in `main.py`)**:
  * It is the main window of the application.
  * Configures the interface, loads images, and manages navigation to other tools.

* **`Calendar` (in `modules/calendar.py`)**:
  * Manages the list of active events and used resources.
  * Handles saving and loading the application state.
  * Coordinates task availability.

* **`event` (in `modules/events.py`)**:
  * Represents an individual event with date, time, and necessary resources.
  * **Validation:** Checks dependencies and resource collisions upon initialization. If there is a conflict, it prevents the event creation.

* **`SegTree` (in `modules/SegTree.py`)**:
  * Implements a **Segment Tree** with *Lazy Propagation*.
  * Used to perform efficient queries on time ranges, allowing quick verification of resource availability or usage in specific intervals.

### 2. Graphical Interface (`modules/gui_core/`)

* **`EventCreator` (in `EventDefiner.py`)**: Window to enter details for new events.
* **`TaskCreator`**: Interface to register new tasks in the system.
* **`TaskRemover`**: Interface to delete existing tasks.
* **`ResAdder`**: Allows adding new resources to the database (`resources.json`).
